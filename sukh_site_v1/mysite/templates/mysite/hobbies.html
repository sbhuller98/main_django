        Baj is a German and King Sheperd cross. He's getting close to a year old
        now, so his days as a puppy are limited. He has been a great addition to
        the family. He gets about 2 hours of walks everyday, and in turn keeps
        all of us active. I'm excited to take him along on my hikes and trips
        this summer.

        I've always enjoyed my hikes. They were a good way to stay fit and
        reward yourself with a nice view. This year, it became almost a
        passtime. With covid restrictions limiting what I could do and making it
        a struggle to stay in shape, I decided to make hiking a weekly thing.
        This summer I did a new hike almost every week and finshed the season by
        climbing the beautiful Panorama Ridge in Garibaldi Provincial Park. The
        pictures on the left are some of my favourite shots from the summer.
