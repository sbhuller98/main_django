       <p class = 'para_body'>I starting working on this site in January 2021. It was my first ever full site build and I wanted to build a portfolio to showcase my skills. I learned how to integrate HTML and CSS. The files I wrote later on are much cleaner and were quicker to write once I figured out how to structure the CSS.</p>

       <p class = 'para_body'>This project was started and completed in Spring 2020. This Java application uses libraries such as JavaFX and JDBC. The database is built with mySQL.

       <p class = 'para_body'>I went to the library to do homework and forgot my calculator. Luckily, I was only doing some basic calculations so I wasn't too worried. I started using the calculator built into my computer and was curious how it was implemented. This led me to try to build a basic calculator in Javascript. I hope to add scientific calculator features in the future.</p>
